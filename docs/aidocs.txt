EVE Online Planetary Interaction (PI) Template JSON Documentation
Version: 1.1 (Updated 2024-07-28)

This document details the structure and interpretation of the JSON format used when exporting Planetary Interaction colony layouts ("templates") from the EVE Online client. Understanding this format is crucial for developers creating third-party tools for visualizing, analyzing, or sharing PI setups.

1. Introduction
EVE Online allows players to export their planetary colony layouts as JSON strings. This enables sharing setups or using external tools. The JSON contains information about the placed structures (pins), their connections (links), the flow of materials (routes), and basic metadata.

Target Audience: Developers of third-party EVE Online applications, tools, or websites dealing with PI visualization or analysis.

Key Challenge: The JSON format uses internal Type IDs and Schematic IDs. To make sense of the template, an external mapping (configuration) is required to translate these IDs into human-readable names (e.g., Facility types, Commodity names, Schematic names) and potentially understand recipes (schematic inputs/outputs, although recipe info is NOT part of the export).

2. Overall JSON Schema
A typical exported PI template JSON object has the following top-level keys:

```json
{
  "CmdCtrLv": 5,                    // Integer: Command Center level required
  "Cmt": "My Awesome P2 Factory",   // String: User-defined template name/comment
  "Diam": 6800.0,                 // Float: Planet diameter (informational)
  "Pln": 2016,                    // Integer: Planet Type ID (e.g., 2016 = Barren)
  "P": [ ... ],                   // List: Pin/Structure definitions
  "L": [ ... ],                   // List: Link definitions
  "R": [ ... ]                    // List: Route definitions
}
